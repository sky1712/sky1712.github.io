Hi! I'm Akash, currently pursuing my M.S in Machine Learning in Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Prior to this I completed my B.S in Mathematics from Indian Institute of Science (IISc). I am primarily interested in theoritical guarantees of ML algorithms and their applications in real world problems. Presently I'm being advised by [Prof. Sivaraman Balakrishnan](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~siva/) and [Saurabh Garg](https://saurabhgarg1996.github.io/) on developing provable algorithms for unsupervised domain adaptation.
